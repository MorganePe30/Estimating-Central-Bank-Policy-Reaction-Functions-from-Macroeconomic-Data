# Project Title and Category :
# Title :
Estimating Central Bank Policy Reaction Functions from Macroeconomic Data
# Category :
Statistical Analysis Tools
# Problem statement :
Central banks adjust their interest rates based on inflation and the economic situation. I will use the Taylor rule to formalize this relationship, although the exact parameters may vary from one central bank to another or over time. My goal is to empirically estimate this reaction function in order to understand the behavior of monetary policy.
# Motivation :
Combine my knowledge of economics (macro/monetary) with my skills in data science (analysis, modeling, interpretation)
